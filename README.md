Chest X-Ray Classification
-   website and app that can detect covid, pneumonia, tuberculosis.
-   Deep Learning has been used to detect the disease by using a Convolutional Neural Network(MobileNetV2) which performs classification
-   Decentralised and Secure


# Technologies Used

## IPFS

-   InterPlanetary File System peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed manner.
    
-   Distributed and Decentralised File Sharing system
    
-   A file gets divided into pieces and gets distributed whole over internet
    
-   Files gets encrypted and gets uploaded

# Working Explanation

1.  Create a account and Login to the website
    
2.  Checkout the upload page to check your X-Ray.
    
3.  Result will be displayed.
    
4.  Precautions and safety measures are also provided depending upon the result of the X-Ray.
    
5.  Can also check the profile page for previous X-Ray checks.
# Notable Features

-   This project helps users check their Chest X-Ray reports in a matter of seconds.
    
-   A Chest X-Ray image classification based website and app that can detect Covid-19, Pneumonia and Tuberculosis.
    
-   A decentralised and secure chest X-Ray classification website.
    
-   The user can login and upload an image of the Chest X-Ray which will be safely secured on Blockchain.
    
-   Alan AI has also been integrated for smooth workflow.
    
-   The user can also view a history of their medical chest X-Ray reports which can be downloaded in the form of a pdf.
